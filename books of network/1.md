Since you’ve already confirmed connectivity, captured packets, and seen DNS/ARP chatter, you’ve got a solid baseline. Here are **next layers of experiments** you can try with your Ubuntu ↔ phone hotspot setup:

---

## 🔎 Network Discovery & Mapping

- **Install `nmap`** and run:
  
  ```bash
  nmap -sn 192.168.194.0/24
  ```
  
  → Discover all devices connected to your phone’s hotspot.

- **Check MAC vendors**:
  
  ```bash
  arp -a
  ```
  
  → See which devices are present and their hardware addresses.

---

## 📡 Traffic Analysis

- **Capture DNS only**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i wlp3s0 port 53
  ```
  
  → Watch all domain lookups your PC makes through the phone.

- **Filter HTTPS traffic**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i wlp3s0 port 443
  ```
  
  → Observe encrypted sessions (you’ll see endpoints, not content).

---

## 🔒 Firewall & Routing Experiments

- **Block specific domains**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -m string --string "copilot.microsoft.com" --algo bm -j DROP
  ```
  
  → Prevent DNS resolution for a target domain.

- **Redirect traffic** (advanced):  
  Use `iptables` or `nftables` to reroute traffic through a local proxy.

---

## 🧪 Services Between PC & Phone

- **Run a local server on Ubuntu**:
  
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8080
  ```
  
  → Then connect from your phone’s browser to `http://192.168.194.82:8080`.

- **Reverse tethering**: Share Ubuntu’s internet back to your phone (via USB or Wi-Fi hotspot).

## 📓 Documentation Experiments

Since you love cheat-sheets:

- Build a **“Book of Networking to Phone”** section:
  - Commands: `ping`, `nmap`, `tcpdump`, `traceroute`
  - Expected outputs: DNS queries, ARP replies
  - Notes: Gateway IP, subnet, MAC addresses

---

## 🚀 Advanced Ideas

- **Packet replay**: Capture traffic with `tcpdump`, then replay with `tcpreplay` to simulate conditions.
- **Latency tests**: Use `iperf3` between phone and PC to measure throughput.
- **VPN over hotspot**: Run a VPN client on Ubuntu and observe how traffic encapsulates through your phone.

👉 Do you want me to draft a **ready-to-use Markdown cheat-sheet** with these experiments (commands + expected outcomes), so you can drop it straight into your notes and expand your “Book of Networking”?
